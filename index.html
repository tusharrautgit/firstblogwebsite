                <h1>HTML</h1>
                <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content.
                    For
                    example, content could be structured within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or using
                    images and data tables. As the title suggests, this article will give you a basic understanding of
                    HTML
                    and its functions.</p>
                <p>HTML is a markup language that defines the structure of your content. HTML consists of a series of
                    elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a
                    certain
                    way, or act a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else,
                    can
                    italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on.</p>

            <div>
                <h1>CSS</h1>
                <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is the code that styles web content. CSS basics walks through what you
                    need
                    to get started.
                    Like HTML, CSS is not a programming language. It's not a markup language either. CSS is a style
                    sheet
                    language. CSS is what you use to selectively style HTML elements.

                <h1>JAVASCRIPT</h1>
                <p>JavaScript is a programming language that adds interactivity to your website. This happens in games,
                    in
                    the behavior of responses when buttons are pressed or with data entry on forms; with dynamic
                    styling;
                    with animation, etc. This article helps you get started with JavaScript and furthers your
                    understanding
                    of what is possible.</p>
                <p> JavaScript is a powerful programming language that can add interactivity to a website. It was
                    invented
                    by Brendan Eich.

                    JavaScript is versatile and beginner-friendly. With more experience, you'll be able to create games,
                    animated 2D and 3D graphics, comprehensive database-driven apps, and much more!

                    JavaScript itself is relatively compact, yet very flexible. Developers have written a variety of
                    tools
                    on top of the core JavaScript language, unlocking a vast amount of functionality with minimum
                    effort.
                    These include:

                    Browser Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) built into web browsers, providing functionality
                    such
                    as dynamically creating HTML and setting CSS styles; collecting and manipulating a video stream from
                    a
                    user's webcam, or generating 3D graphics and audio samples.
                    Third-party APIs that allow developers to incorporate functionality in sites from other content
                    providers, such as Twitter or Facebook.
                    Third-party frameworks and libraries that you can apply to HTML to accelerate the work of building
                    sites
                    and applications.

                    It's outside the scope of this article—as a light introduction to JavaScript—to present the details
                    of
                    how the core JavaScript language is different from the tools listed above. You can learn more in
                    MDN's
                    JavaScript learning area, as well as in other parts of MDN.

                    The section below introduces some aspects of the core language and offers an opportunity to play
                    with a
                    few browser API features too. Have fun!</p>
